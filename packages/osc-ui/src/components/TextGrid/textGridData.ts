            "Distance learning simply takes location out of the equation when it comes to studying your course. You are still able to study a fully recognised and accredited course or qualification with an online college without the commute or class timetables. You choose where you study, whether its from home, work, your commute, or a local coffee shop. It's about you taking control of your studies and learning in an environment that works best for you.",

            "Home learning puts you in charge of your studies. This means you can study around your commitments instead of fitting your life around your learning. On each course page on our website, you'll find approximately how many study hours are required for each course, which should help you decide if it is achievable alongside your other commitments. There are no scheduled classes to attend or timetables to abide by. Our online courses are designed for people who need to fit learning around their existing commitments.",

Throughout your study experience, you will receive a specialist, personal tutor, who will offer unlimited expert support and guidance during your course. You'll have full access to our online helpdesk and our learner services team is just a phone call away.",

For most of our distance learning courses, you will be able to choose from the following two options: Study pack: if you choose the study pack option, you will be sent a set of printed course materials which you can highlight and annotate as you go. Study online: if you choose the online study option, you will be sent your login details to our online learning portal through which you will access your digital course materials.',
